# Agricultural Carbon Dioxide Emissions - by Country


As we noted on the previous slide, it may be more interesting to break down the relative differences by country, rather than aggregating them and allowing large countries (such as China or India) to skew the overall quantities of CO2 emissions. In this slide, we open up the visualization to you, to try and find interesting breakdowns and relationships between the different factors across countries. Try to find your country, and think to yourself if the results line up with your expectations!
